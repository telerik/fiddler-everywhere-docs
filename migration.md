## Description



Until recently, the Fiddler Everywhere license and seats were managed in a dedicated system known as Fiddler Dashboard. However, as Fiddler Everywhere is part of the extensive portfolio of products developed by Progress, the team decided to integrate the license and seat management at the [unified Telerik system for subscription management](https://www.telerik.com/account/). This way, our clients will benefit from using a single account and have a single entry point for managing all active product licenses. This article explains how to migrate your existing Fiddler subscription plan from the obsolete system to the unified Telerik system.


## Migrating Fiddler Everywhere License

The license owner can migrate the active Fiddler Everywhere subscription and all assigned seats by executing the following steps:

1. Open the **latest** version of the Fiddler Everywhere application. Alternatively, open the login page from the Fiddler Dashboard site at https://dashboard.getfiddler.com/login 

1. Follow the **Sign In** link. You will land on the new login form that prompts you to enter your Fiddler Everywhere email.

    * In case the email exist as an active Telerik account, it will prompt for your Telerik credentials. Upon successful login, you can start managing your migrated license at https://www.telerik.com/account/your-licenses and using the Fiddler Everywhere (if your email is also assigned as a seat).

## Migrating Fiddler Everywhere Assigned Seats

All assigned seats are automatically migrated to the new Telerik administrative panel after the license owner completes the migration. Seats that are not migrated will be presented with an informative banner within the application.
