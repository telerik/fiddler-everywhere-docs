## Description


Until recently, the Fiddler Everywhere license and seats were managed in a dedicated system known as Fiddler Dashboard. However, as Fiddler Everywhere is part of the extensive portfolio of products developed by Progress, the team decided to integrate the license and seat management at the [unified Telerik system for subscription management](https://www.telerik.com/account/). This way, our clients will benefit from using a single account and have a single entry point for managing all active product licenses. This article explains how to migrate your existing Fiddler subscription plan from the obsolete system to the unified Telerik system.


## Migrating Fiddler Everywhere License

The license owner can migrate the active Fiddler Everywhere subscription and all assigned seats through the following steps:

1. Open [the **latest** version of the Fiddler Everywhere application](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler-everywhere). Alternatively, open the login page from the Fiddler Dashboard site at https://dashboard.getfiddler.com/login 

1. Follow the **Sign In** link. You will land on the new login form that prompts you to enter your Fiddler Everywhere email.

    >important Sign in or create Telerik account with the same email you registered with your original Fiddler account.

1. Enter the Fiddler Everywhere license owner email.

    * If the email already exist as an active Telerik account, it will prompt for your Telerik credentials. Upon successful login, you can start managing your migrated license at https://www.telerik.com/account/your-licenses and use the Fiddler Everywhere application (if your email is also assigned as a seat).

    * If the email does **not** exist as an active Telerik account, you will be prompted to create an accont by inputing a password and account information.

        Confirm and finalize your Telerik account creation through the received activation link. Once the activation is completed, you can manage your migrated license at https://www.telerik.com/account/your-licenses and use the Fiddler Everywhere application (if your email is also assigned as a seat).


## Migrating Fiddler Everywhere Assigned Seats

After the license owner completes the migration all assigned seats are automatically migrated to the new Telerik administrative panel. Seats that are not migrated will be presented with an informative banner within the application.
