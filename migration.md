## Migrating Fiddler Accounts and Subscriptions


The Fiddler products are now part of an extensive portfolio of products developed by Progress Telerik. This article explains how to migrate your existing Fiddler accounts and subscriptions to the new unified Telerik system.

Depending on the license status, your Fiddler account presents one of the following roles:

* **License holder**&mdash;This is the user who owns and manages the Fiddler subscriptions. The license holder can edit or update subscriptions and access billing details and invoices. The license holder can also access the product if they have an assigned Fiddler seat (licensed developer).

* **Licensed developer**&mdash;This user has an assigned seat to a Fiddler subscription and has access to the respective Fiddler product.

## Account Migration

>note The following steps are directed at all users â€“ **license holders** and **licensed developers**.

Each Fiddler account must migrate to the Telerik system and create a Telerik account through the following steps:

1. Open the preferred Fiddler application.

    * (for Fiddler Everywhere users) Install and open the latest version of the [Fiddler Everywhere application](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler-everywhere).
    
    * (for Fiddler Jam portal users) Open the [Fiddler Jam portal](https://jam.getfiddler.com). 

    * (for Fiddler license holders) Open the [Fiddler Dashboard site](https://dashboard.getfiddler.com/login).

1. Follow the **Sign In or Create a New Account** link.

1. Enter your Fiddler account email or sign in with Google.

    >important To migrate successfully, create a new Telerik account (or use Google authentication) with the **same** email address used with your original Fiddler account. If you use a different email, the system will perceive you as a new user and you will not see your previous Fiddler subscription and data.

1. Enter a password and account information in the account creation form.

1. After confirmation, you will receive an email with an account activation link.

1. Open the activation link to finalize your Telerik account creation 

1. Once the activation completes, you can immediately sign in and continue using your Fiddler product.

After a successful migration, you will see a message confirming the operation, and your payment details will be deleted from the old Fiddler system. From that moment on, all future subscription renewals will be charged through the Telerik system only (processed by Cybersource) using the selected payment method. Note that if you migration is not succesfull, you will see an error or warning message instead of the sdcreen depiected below - in such case, please contact us through [the Support Center](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center/contact-us/licensing-support).
