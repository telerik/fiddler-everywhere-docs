## Description


Until recently, the account owners managed the Fiddler Everywhere license and seats in a dedicated system known as Fiddler Dashboard. However, Fiddler products are now part of an extensive portfolio of products developed by Progress. To provide a better experience and access to all Progress Telerik products and services, Fiddler is migrating to the [unified Telerik system for account and subscription management](https://www.telerik.com/account/. This way, you will benefit from using a single account and have a single entry point for managing all active product licenses. This article explains migrating your existing Fiddler licenses and seats from the obsolete system to the unified Telerik system.

The license owner can migrate the active Fiddler product subscription and all assigned seats through the following steps:

1. Open the licensed product login forms.

    * (Fiddler Everywhere) Open the latest version of the Fiddler Everywhere application to migrate a Fiddler Everywhere license.
    
    * (Fiddler Jam) Open the [Fiddler Jam portal](https://jam.getfiddler.com) to migrate a Fiddlerm Jam license. 

    * (Fiddler Everywhere & Fiddler Jam) Open the login page from the [Fiddler Dashboard site](https://dashboard.getfiddler.com/login) to migrate all product licenses.

1. Follow the **Sign In** link.

Upon successful login, you can start managing your migrated license at https://www.telerik.com/account/your-licenses and use the Fiddler Everywhere application (in case your owner email is also an assigned seat).

## Migrating Fiddler Assigned Seats

After the [account owner completes the license migration](#migrating-fiddler-licenses), all assigned seats automatically migrate to the new unified Telerik system. Seated accounts that are not migrated will see an explanatory banner.
