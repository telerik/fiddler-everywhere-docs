# Fiddler Reporter Introduction

Progress® Telerik® Fiddler Reporter is a cross-platform desktop tool that monitors, and logs all HTTPS traffic, issues requests between a computer and the Internet. It allows you to quickly capture, save and export HTTPS traffic on any machine without the need for exlicit installation. It's free to use and doesn't require Fiddler Everywhere license and as such can be used on any computer including third-party devices, test devices, servers, and any other compatible Windows or macOS device.

## How Fiddler Reporter Works

The main purpose of the Fiddler Everywhere Reporter is to serve as an extension tool of the Fiddler Everywhere application that aims to capture traffic on the end user (remote) and share it with a user holding an active license for Fiddler Everywhere.

 Any user can download Fiddler Reporter and start it immediatelly without the need for an explicit installation. Once the tool starts you can choose the prefered capturing mode and capture the targeted HTTPS traffic. Then once the capturing is complete, the Fiddler EReporter tool presents the option to save the captured traffis as a SAZ file (also known as an Fiddler archive). The SAZ archive will contain a snapshot of all captured HTTPS sessions, which , at any point, can be inspected in details and tailored in Fiddler Everywhere.
