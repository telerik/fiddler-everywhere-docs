Our product subscription include unlimited access to the support service. In order to keep providing our industry-leading level of support, we have instituted a fair usage policy for our support services:
A support manager will review customer activities that exceed at least ten times the average amount of support requests to determine if such activities are deemed to be excessive.

>tip Users without an active subscription can ask their questions in the [Fiddler Everywhere community forum](https://community.getfiddler.com/support/discussions). Posting in the forums does not guarantee a response from the Fiddler Everywhere team, although we are trying to answer all questions.

### How can I submit feature requests?

## What's included in Support?

### Guidance for built-in features

We provide guidance and explanation for built-in features of the products. We provide clients with references to existing resources to demonstrate the intended use of the product. We also provide information on proper configuration of the product.

### Bug Confirmation

We provide support to diagnose and confirm reported product bugs. In the process of investigating reports, we may request that clients isolate the issue and provide us with additional information such as steps to reproduce it.

### Workarounds

We are committed to suggesting workarounds, when available, for confirmed product bugs. Where possible, we also provide information on releases containing a fix for a bug or an implemented feature request.
