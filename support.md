# Support Options

Fiddler Everywhere provides full-scale support for its paid subscription and trial users. It also maintains additional support channels where you can ask questions, submit feature requests, report bugs, and more.

## Paid Subscription and Trial Users Support  

Fiddler license holders and anyone in an active trial can take advantage of the Fiddler Everywhere outstanding customer support delivered by the developers who built the tool. Use the [**Contact Support**]({%slug file-menu%}#contact-support) option within the Fiddler Everywhere application to open the [support center](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center) and submit a support ticket.

The subscription plan includes unlimited access to Fiddler's dedicated support services. However, to keep providing an industry-leading support experience, we have instituted a fair usage policy for support services. This means that if customer activity exceeds at least ten times the average, it may be reviewed by a Fiddler support manager at any time to assess whether the number of support requests is excessive and whether the user is in violation of the fair usage policy.

Support services for paid subscription or trial users provide the following support services:

* Guidance on handling existing features&mdash;You will receive references to existing resources, which demonstrate the product's intended use, and information on the product's proper configuration.

* Confirmation of bug reports&mdash;You can count on our support for diagnosing and confirming reported product bugs. However, during the report investigation, we may ask you to isolate the issue and provide additional information or steps to reproduce it.

* Sharing available workarounds&mdash;If available, you will get suggested workarounds for confirmed product bugs or for performing scenarios not implemented as built-in functionalities. You will also access service packs, hotfixes, and support when [logging feature requests through the support center](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center).
