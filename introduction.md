## Key Features

Fiddler Everywhere delivers a range of handy and user-friendly features whose number and further development are not limited by the list in this section&mdash;the Fiddler team constantly invests efforts to improve the performance and add more value to the existing web-debugging tool and build on top of its available features.


### System Traffic Capturing

Fiddler Everywhere inspects and logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your computer and the Internet, and enables you to capture traffic from virtually any application that supports a system proxy. [Read more about capturing HTTP(S) traffic with Fiddler Everywhere...]({% slug capture-traffic-get-started %}#system-capturing)


### Preconfigured Browser Capturing

Fiddler Everywhere provides preconfigured options for automatic browser HTTP(S) capturing without the need to modify the operating system proxy. [Read more about the preconfigured browser capturing...]({% slug capture-traffic-get-started %}#preconfigured-browser-capturing
)


### Traffic Analysis

Fiddler Everywhere provides an HTTP(S) traffic-analyzing functionality, which renders the captured information in a structured way and visualizes various statistical data for one or more captured sessions. You can also decrypt secure traffic and save, receive, and share captured traffic with collaborators.

### Request and Response Mocking

Fiddler supports the mocking and modification of requests and responses on any application. In this way, you can quickly and easily change HTTP(S) requests and responses without the need to update the code.

### API Composing

Fiddler Everywhere comes with an API Composer, which allows you to test APIs by creating and sending requests as well as save and share composed APIs. You can use the API composing feature both when developing new APIs and when testing existing APIs.
