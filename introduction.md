# Welcome to Fiddler Everywhere!

[**Fiddler Everywhere**](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler-everywhere) is a high performance, cross-platform web debugging proxy for any browser, system or platform. It is a web debugging tool that logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your computer and the Internet, inspects and edits traffic, issue requests, and fiddle with incoming and outgoing data.

**HTTP(S) traffic Inspection and Analysis**

Fiddler Everywhere logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your computer and the Internet. It captures traffic from virtually any application that supports a system proxy.

**Request and Response Mocking**

Fiddler support mocking or modifying request and responses on any application. It’s a quick and easy way to change HTTP(S) requests and responses without changing the code.

**API Composing**

Use Fiddler API Composer to test APIs by creating and sending requests. Useful while developing new APIs or when testing existing APIs.
