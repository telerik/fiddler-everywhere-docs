### System Traffic Capturing

Fiddler Everywhere inspects and logs all HTTP(S) and WebSocket traffic between your computer and the Internet, and enables you to capture traffic from virtually any application that supports a system proxy.

### Preconfigured Browser Capturing

Fiddler Everywhere provides preconfigured options for automatic, sandboxed, browser HTTP(S) capturing without the need to modify the operating system proxy.

### Traffic Analysis

Fiddler Everywhere provides an HTTP(S) and WebSocket traffic-analyzing functionality, which renders the captured information in a structured way and visualizes various statistical data for one or more captured sessions. You can also decrypt secure traffic and save, receive, and share captured traffic with collaborators.
