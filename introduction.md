# Welcome to Fiddler Everywhere!

Progress® Telerik® Fiddler Everywhere is a web-debugging tool that monitors, inspects, edits, and logs all HTTP(S) traffic, issues requests between your computer and the Internet, and fiddles with incoming and outgoing data. It is a high-performance, cross-platform proxy for any browser, system, or platform.

## Key Features

Fiddler Everywhere delivers a range of handy and user-friendly features whose number and further development are not limited by the list in this section&mdash;the Fiddler team constantly invests efforts to improve the performance and add more value to the existing web-debugging proxy tool and build on top of its available features.


### System Traffic Capturing

Fiddler Everywhere inspects and logs all HTTP(S), WebSocket, Server-Sent Events, and gRPC traffic between your computer and the Internet and enables you to capture traffic from virtually any application that supports a system proxy. [Read more about capturing HTTP(S) traffic with Fiddler Everywhere...]({% slug capture-system-traffic %})


### Independent Browser Capturing

Fiddler Everywhere provides an option for automatic, sandboxed browser HTTP(S) capturing without modifying the operating system proxy. [Read more about the independent Fiddler Everywhere browser capturing...]({% slug capture-browser-traffic %})


### Terminal Capturing

Fiddler Everywhere provides an option for automatic, sandboxed, terminal HTTP(S) capturing. [Read more about the Fiddler's terminal capturing...]({%slug capture-terminal-traffic%})


### Traffic Analysis

Fiddler Everywhere provides an HTTP(S) and WebSocket traffic-analyzing functionality, which renders the captured information in a structured way and visualizes various statistical data for one or more captured sessions. You can also decrypt secure traffic and save, receive, compare, and share captured traffic with collaborators.

### Modern HTTP and TLS version support

Fiddler Everywhere supports the used versions of the HTTP protocol, including the widely used HTTP/1.1 and the latest major revision HTTP/2. Fiddler Everywhere supports obsolete and modern SSL and TLS versions, including TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.

### Request and Response Mocking

### API Composing

Fiddler Everywhere comes with an API Composer, which allows you to test REST and SOAP APIs by creating and sending requests and saving and sharing composed APIs. You can use the API composing feature when developing new APIs and testing existing ones.
