# Welcome to Fiddler Everywhere!

Progress® Telerik® Fiddler™ Everywhere is a web-debugging tool that inspects, edits, and logs all HTTP(S) traffic, and issue requests between your computer and the Internet, and fiddles with incoming and outgoing data. It is a high performance, cross-platform proxy for any browser, system, or platform.

## Key Features

Fiddler Everywhere delivers a range of handy and user-friendly features whose number and further development are not limited by the list in this section&mdash;the Fiddler team constantly invests efforts to improve the performance and add more value to the existing web-debugging tool, and build on top of its available features.

### HTTP(S) Traffic Inspection and Analysis

Fiddler Everywhere inspects and logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your computer and the Internet, and enables you to capture traffic from virtually any application that supports a system proxy. You can also decrypt secure (HTTPS) traffic and save, receive, and share captured traffic with collaborators. [Read more about...]

### Request and Response Mocking

Fiddler supports the mocking and modification of requests and responses on any application. In this way, you can quickly and easily change HTTP(S) requests and responses without the need to update the code. [Read more about...]

### API Composing

Fiddler Everywhere comes with an API Composer, which allows you to test APIs by creating and sending requests as well as save and share composed APIs. You can use the API composing feature both when developing new APIs and when testing existing APIs.

### Platform-Agnostic Integration

Fiddler provides platform-agnostic compatibility that enables you to run it on macOS, Windows, and Linux system-operating machines.

### Styling Options

Fiddler Everywhere delivers a modern, intuitive UI and a set of popular themes, including Bootstrap and Material, all of which can be easily customized with the Progress ThemeBuilder online utility. [Read more about modifying the appearance of the Fiddler web-debugging tool...]

## Support Options

Generally, Fiddler Everywhere provides a full-scale support for its paid subscription and trial users, and also maintains additional support channels where you can ask questions, submit feature requests, report bugs, and more.

### Paid Subscription and Trial Users Support  

Fiddler license holders and anyone in an active trial can take advantage of the Fiddler Everywhere outstanding customer support delivered by the actual developers who built the tool. To submit a support ticket, use the [Fiddler support system](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-tickets).

The subscription plan includes unlimited access to the Fiddler's dedicated support services. However, to keep providing an industry-leading support experience, we have instituted a fair usage policy for support services. Practically, this means that if customer activity exceeds at least ten times the average, it may be reviewed by a Fiddler support manager at any time to assess whether the number of support requests is excessive and the user is in violation of the fair usage policy.

Support services for paid subscription or trial users provide the following support services:

* Guidance on handling existing features&mdash;You will receive references to existing resources, which demonstrate the intended use of the product, and also information on the proper configuration of the product.
* Confirmation of bug reports&mdash;You can count on our support for diagnosing and confirming reported product bugs. However, during the report investigation we may ask you to isolate the issue and provide additional information or steps to reproduce it.
* Sharing available workarounds&mdash;If available, you will get suggested workarounds for confirmed product bugs or for performing scenarios that are not implemented as built-in functionalities. You will also get access to service packs and hotfixes as well as support when [logging feature requests](https://community.getfiddler.com/support/discussions/forums/12000000868).
