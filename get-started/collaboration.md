# Collaboration

The Fiddler Everywhere client provides a secure method for sharing network debugging logs with your teams for analysis, communication, and resolution.

As compared with previous Fiddler Everywhere versions where collaboration was limited to exporting `.saz` files and sharing them over a different channel, now all sharing and commenting happen directly within the UI in a secure and comfortable manner.

## Saving and Sharing Sessions

In Fiddler Everywhere you can save, and later on view and share captured network sessions with your team, as well as invite other team members to collaborate.

### Saving Sessions

To save a session:

 1. [Capture the traffic]({%slug capture-traffic-get-started%}).
 1. Use any of the available approaches to save a captured session:
    - The **Save**  option of the [**Live Traffic** toolbar]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#live-traffic-toolbar).
    - The **Save** option from the context menu of the [**Live Traffic** list]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#live-traffic-list).
    - The [context menu]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#context-menu-options), which allows you to export the captured traffic in various formats such as `SAZ`, `HTTPArchive`, `WCAT`, `MeddlerScript`, `cURLScript`, and others.

### Sharing Sessions

To share a session with a collaborator:

 1. [Capture the traffic]({%slug capture-traffic-get-started%}) that you want to share with your collaborators. Alternatively, select a saved session from the [**Sessions** list]({%slug saved-sessions-tab%}).
 1. Use any of the supported approaches to share a captured session:
    - The **Share** option of the [**Live Traffic** toolbar]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#live-traffic-toolbar)&mdash;Click **Share** to prompt two consecutive windows for entering the information related to saving and sharing.
    - The **Share** option from the context menu of the [**Live Traffic** list]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#live-traffic-list)&mdash;Click **Share** to prompt two consecutive windows for entering the information related to saving and sharing.
    - The **Share** button of the [**Sessions** list]({%slug saved-sessions-tab%})&mdash;The list contains your previously saved sessions or sessions that were shared with you. Click the **Share** button to prompt a window for entering the information related to sharing.
    - The [context menu]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#context-menu-options) allows you to export various formats such as `SAZ`, `HTTPArchive`, `WCAT`, `MeddlerScript`, `cURLScript`, and others.

### Deleting Shared Sessions

Fiddler Everywhere provides options for deleting previously shared sessions. To select the sessions you want to delete, go to the **Sessions** list and use the **Delete** button. All users who are added as collaborators will be notified [through the notification bar and with an email message](#notifications-for-shared-content) that the shared session is now deleted. To restore deleted sessions, use the [**Shared Sessions** option]({%slug saved-sessions-tab%}#shared-sessions).

## Adding Context for Collaborators

Some network sessions may lack important details that are not captured in the technical data. Fiddler Everywhere provides options for you and your collaborators to add context to the captured and shared sessions, comment in the same thread of communication as well as provide additional information by adding **comments** per session and **notes** per shared entities.

### Comments

Add a custom comment to one or more captured sessions to provide additional context.

1. Select a session from the [**Live Traffic** list]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#live-traffic-list) or load saved sessions from the [**Sessions** list]({%slug saved-sessions-tab%}).
1. Add a comment by using the **Comment** option from the context menu or press the **M** key while selecting the desired sessions. As a result, the newly added comment will appear in [the **Comments** column]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#live-traffic-list).

### Notes

Add additional context in the form of a descriptive note while sharing one or more session.

1. Use the **Share** option from the [**Live Traffic toolbar**]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#live-traffic-toolbar) or the **Share** button in the [**Sessions** list]({%slug saved-sessions-tab%}).
1. In the first dialog window, provide a name for the shared sessions.
1. In the second dialog window, provide the additional information in the **Add a note** field. As a result, the note will be rendered as context in the email received by the collaborators.

## Notifications for Shared Content

The Fiddler Everywhere client informs the collaborators about shared sessions in the following ways:
- Collaborators receive an email with an invitation to open the shared session. If the session creator has added a note, the email will display the note as well.
- All listed collaborators receive a notification within the Fiddler Everywhere client. To open the share session in a separate tab, click the notification.
