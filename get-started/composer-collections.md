# Organize Requests into Collections

With the Fiddler Everywhere client, you can save and organize multiple composed requests through the [**Requests**]({%slug saved-requests-tab%}) list. Multiple requests (or folders containg requests) can be arranged in collections from where they can be reloaded and executed promptly. The **Requests** list is located to the left (below the **Sessions** list) and can hold multiple collections.

Create your first collection of composed requests by following these steps:

1. Create your new API request by clicking the **"+"** button in the collections. This action will open a new **Composer** tab with *Untitled* as default name.

2. After the request is composed, press **Save**. Alternatively, choose **Save as** option to prevent overwriting an existing entry.

3. Enter a request name and select the collection (folder) in which the request will be saved. Alternatively, you can create a new collection by pressing the folder icon to the right.

3. Press **Save** to close the dialog window and add the request to the collection.
