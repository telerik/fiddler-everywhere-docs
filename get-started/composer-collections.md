# Organizing API Requests into Collections

The Fiddler Everywhere client provides options for saving and organizing multiple requests, which are composed by using the API Composer, through its [**Requests**]({%slug saved-requests-tab%}) list.

**Requests** enables you to arrange multiple requests or request folders in collections which can be promptly reloaded and executed.

To create a collection of composed requests:

1. Create a new API request by clicking the **"+"** button in the collections. This action will open a new **Composer** tab with *Untitled* as the default name.

2. After the request is composed, press **Save**;. Alternatively, choose **Save as** to prevent overwriting an existing entry.

3. Enter a request name and select the collection (folder) in which the request will be saved. Alternatively, you can create a new collection by pressing the folder icon to the right.

3. Press **Save** to close the dialog window and add the request to the collection.
