# Capturing iOS Traffic

This article describes using Fiddler Everywhere to capture HTTPS traffic from iOS devices and simulators.

To capture HTTPS traffic on iOS devices or simulators, perform the following steps:

1. [Provide the prerequisites](#prerequisites).
1. [Configure Fiddler Everywhere](#configuring-fiddler-everywhere-host).
1. [Configure the iOS device](#configuring-ios-devices).
1. [Configure the iOS simulator](#configuring-ios-simulator).
1. [Capture mobile traffic](#capture-traffic).

## Prerequisites

- Install [the latest version of Fiddler Everywhere](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler-everywhere).

- Use an iOS device or an iOS simulator within the same local network as the Fiddler Everywhere host.

>important It's common for many company networks to be restricted by security tooling or administrative policies. To capture remote traffic, ensure that your system administrators are not limiting the network discovery and usage, or consider using a public hotspot for your Fiddler host and remote device.


## Configuring Fiddler Everywhere Host

1. Enable the remote connections of Fiddler Everywhere through **Settings** > **Connections** > **Allow remote computers to connect**. Combine it with **Keep it ON after app restart** if you want to persist the setting for subsequent application startups.

1. Check the local IP address of the host where the Fiddler Everywhere application runs. You can use [the connection status on the lower right-hand side]({%slug connections-section%}) to obtain the host IP address. Alternatively, you can get the IP address while using  **ipconfig**/ **ifconfig** (depending on the OS). For demonstration purposes, let's assume that the local IP of the Fiddler Everywhere machine is **192.168.0.101**.

1. Ensure that the [**Capture HTTPS traffic** option]({%slug decrypt-https-traffic%}) is enabled.

>tip: If you only need to capture remote traffic, then there is no need to install the Fiddler CA on the Fiddler host machine. You only need to download and install the Fiddler CA on the remote device. Once the proxy configuration is in place, Fiddler Everywhere will automatically capture and decrypt the remote HTTPS traffic.

## Configuring iOS Devices

Refer to the following steps to configure real iOS devices to work alongside a Fiddler Everywhere host. For more information on working with iOS simulators, refer to the section about [configuring iOS simulators](#configure-the-ios-simulator). Real iOS devices and iOS simulators must be discoverable on the same local network.


1. On your iOS device, go to **Settings** > **WiFi**.

1. Find your current network and click the **i** icon.

1. Scroll to the bottom and choose **Configure Proxy** > **Manual**.

     - In the **SERVER** field, enter the IP address of the Fiddler Everywhere host&mdash;for example, **192.168.0.101** (for demo purposes, we assume this is the IP of the host that runs Fiddler).

     - Enter the Fiddler Everywhere proxy port in the **PORT** field. By default, the port is **8866**.

    >tip With the current setup, you can capture non-secure HTTP traffic. However, if you try to open any HTTPS website, you'll get the "This site's security certificate is not trusted!" error. To fix this issue, trust the Fiddler root certificate.

1. Open a browser on the iOS device and type the http://ipv4.fiddler:8866 echo service address of Fiddler Everywhere. Follow the Fiddler root certificate link to **download** the Fiddler certificate.

1. On your iOS device, open **General** > **Profile Downloaded** and install the downloaded Fiddler certificate.

1. (iOS 10.3+) Go to **Settings** > **General** > **About** > **Certificate Trust Settings** and enable full trust for the **Fiddler_Root_Certificate_Authority** certificate.

>important The last step is crucial, and HTTPS browsing will fail if the certificate is not trusted! Newer iOS versions will show that the certificate is successfully installed. Still, HTTPS sites will fail to open due to security errors if the certificate is not explicitly enabled/fully trusted.


## Configuring iOS Simulator

The later versions of the iOS simulators, accessible through XCode, use the OS system proxy by default. However, due to [a security limitation](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/124056), the iOS simulator won't access the folders containing the trust certificates. To capture HTTPS traffic, you must manually export and install the Fiddler Everywhere certificate on your iOS simulator.


1. In Fiddler Everywhere, go to **Settings** > **HTTPS** > **Advanced Settings**.

1. Use the **Export root certificate(DER/Binary format)** option from the drop-down menu. As a result, the `Fiddler_Root_Certificate_Authority.crt` file is created in the **Desktop** folder.

1. Start the iOS simulator.

1. Drag and drop the exported certificate in the simulator.

1. In the iOS simulator, go to **Settings** > **General** > **About** > **Certificate Trust Settings** and enable full trust for the certificate named **Fiddler_Root_Certificate_Authority**.

## Capture Traffic

Now you can immediately capture and inspect HTTP/HTTPS traffic from your iOS device. For example, open a Safari browser on your iOS device, type an address of your choice, and observe the captured traffic in the **Live Traffic** grid.

>tip When you've finished debugging, remove the WiFi proxy from your iOS device.

## Bypass the Apple Endpoints

Some Apple services like the Apple Application store and iTunes use certificate pinning as an additional layer of security. That means these services won't trust third-party certificates like the one Fiddler Everywhere installs and operates as a MITM proxy. The above causes significant effects:  

- The TLS handshake fails, not capturing HTTPS traffic from these services.

- The services will fail if the Fiddler Everywhere proxy is set as the proxy for the active internet connection.

To prevent Apple services from losing connectivity, the Fiddler Everywhere application automatically adds the following endpoints to the macOS proxy bypass list:

```
*.apple.com, *.itunes.com, *mzstatic.com
```

However, this is not the case for the other operating systems where these services are not commonly used. If you would like to continue using Apple services like iTunes or AppStore on different operating systems, ensure to add the above endpoints manually as follows:

- Open Fiddler Everywhere on the host machine and go to **Settings > Connections**.

- In the **Bypass Fiddler for URLs that starts with:** field, add the following Apple root domains:

    ```
    *.apple.com, *.itunes.com, *mzstatic.com
    ```

- Click **Save** to persist the change.
