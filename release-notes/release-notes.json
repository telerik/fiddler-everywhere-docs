The Date column’s filter is now Calendar based, which makes it easy to get the information you need for specific date range. With all those changes we unlock new scenarios of using Fiddler Everywhere: finding sessions which take more than specified time has never been so easy. The same is valid for finding requests above specified size, etc."
