## Environment

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Product   |
| Product Version | 1.0.0 and above  |
| 3rd-party tool | [cURL](https://curl.se/) |
| Supported OS | macOS, Linux, Windows |


## Description

Many developers, support engineers, and end-users are familiar with the [cURL](https://curl.se/) as a fast tool for executing and managing requests. How can I easily convert a request that was generated in the [**Composer**]({%slug composer-tab%}) to a cURL script?


## Solution

Fiddler Everywhere version 4.0.0 and above provides an automated export as Curl script through the [Live Traffic list context menu]({%slug web-sessions-list%}).


## Solution (Obsolete)

The [**Composer**]({%slug composer-tab%}) provides options for creating and executing your requests. Each executed request is added to the [**Live Traffic** list]({%slug web-sessions-list%}) as a new session entry.

To convert a request created in the **Composer**:

1. [Create and execute your request in the **Composer**]({%slug composer-get-started%}).
1. Open the [**Live Traffic** list]({%slug web-sessions-list%}) and select the generated session from the executed request above.
1. Open the context menu by right-clicking the session entry and go to **Export** > **Selected Sessions**.
1. From the drop-down menu, choose **cURL Script** and click **Next**.
1. Choose a name and extension for the file. Click **Save**. By default, the file name is the current date and the extension is BAT.

By default, Fiddler Everywhere saves the outputted cURL script as [a BAT file](https://fileinfo.com/extension/bat), which is appropriate for Windows usage. Linux and macOS users might want to change the default extension with the proper format for the OS&mdash;for example, to `*.sh` for the Shell script.

A cURL output generated from Fiddler Everywhere looks similar to the following sample:

```cURL
curl -k -i --raw -o 0.dat "http://httpbin.org/get?theAnswer=42" -H "User-Agent: Fiddler Everywhere" -H "Host: httpbin.org"
```

- The `-k` flag allows insecure server connections when using SSL. Fiddler Everywhere adds the flag to ensure that the cURL script can be executed even with the Fiddler proxy and its certificate in place.
- Fiddler Everywhere internally uses the `-o <x>.dat` to generate different DAT files for each selected session.
- Fiddler Everywhere adds the **User-Agent** header automatically for all requests made with the **Composer**.

You are free to modify, remove and change the generated flags and parameters as per your technical requirements.
