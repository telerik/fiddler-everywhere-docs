## Description

The Fiddler Everywhere certificate is installed to inspect network traffic and debug it. I don't want the traffic monitoring anymore, so how can I remove the HTTPS certificate from my system?

## Solution

To remove the root certificate, follow the steps in each of the sections below depending on the OS you use.

### On macOS

1. In your system, open the Keychain Access application. Select the **login** keychain from the list and **All Items** from the category list.

2. Scroll to the **DO_NOT_TRUST_FiddlerRoot** certificate and press **Delete**.

3. Clicking the **Delete** button prompts a window asking for a confirmation. In the popup window, answer **Yes** and enter your system **Password**. This will update the Keychain settings.
