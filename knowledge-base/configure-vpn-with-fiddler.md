The article covers the specific configuration needed to use Fiddler Everywhere with VPN software like Cisco VPN.

- VPN software with pre-configured VPN network access. The article covers the steps needed for **Cisco VPN**.

## Configuration Steps

>important The steps' executing order is crucial for the proper setup of the Cisco VPN alongside Fiddler Everywhere.

1. Make sure your Cisco VPN client is disconnected.

2. Start Fiddler Everywhere and turn on the **Capturing** mode.

3. Open the **_Settings > HTTP_** menu, add the trust certificate and check the **_Capture HTTPS traffic_** box.

4. Open the **_Settings > Connections_** menu and in **_Bypass Fiddler for URLs that starts with:_** add the VPN addresses of your VPN servers. Press the **Save** button to preserve the bypass list.

    >tip As a separator for multiple addresses in the bypass list, you can use a comma, semicolon, new line, and white space. All separators will be converted to the OS supported separator after saving the values. Once the addresses in **_Bypass Fiddler for URLs that starts with:_** are set, the values are persisted and used by Fiddler Everywhere to set the OSâ€™s bypass list (for example, you can open the **_Proxy Settigns_** on Windows OS and check that the values are persisted in **_Use the proxy server except for addresses that starts with.._** textbox).

5. Start the Cisco VPN client and connect to the VPN network.

6. Start capturing traffic with Fiddler Everywhere.

7. To ensure proper OS network configuration is preserved, refer to the [Disconnection VPN](#disconnecting-vpn) section.

## Disconnecting VPN 

To prevent Cisco VPN from using cached proxy information, we must first stop the Cisco VPN software and then close Fiddler Everywhere (or pause Capturing mode). The workflow for Cisco VPN alongside Fiddler Everywhere is as follows:

1. Start Fiddler Everywhere and enable Capturing mode.

2. Connect the Cisco VPN client.

3. Capture traffic.

4. Disconnect the Cisco VPN client.

5. Stop Fiddler Everywhere with disabled Capturing mode.
