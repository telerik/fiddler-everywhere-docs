## Description

The [Fiddler dashboard site](https://dashboard.getfiddler.com) provided means for managing subscription plans, payments, and the activation of account seats for Fiddler Everywhere and Fiddler Jam. How can I use the functionalities that were previously accessible from [https://dashboard.getfiddler.com](https://dashboard.getfiddler.com) to activate and manage my subscriptions?

## Solution

The latest version of the Fiddler Everywhere application is now using **the unified Telerik system** for subscription management, and the old [Fiddler dashboard site](https://dashboard.getfiddler.com) is now obsolete. Refer to [**the migration guidelines**](slug://migrate-fiddler-subscriptions) for detailed instructions on how to migrate your active subscription to Telerik. Once your account and subscription are successfully migrated, you can use the unified Telerik system to manage your license and product seats through the following links:

- ["My Account" section](https://www.telerik.com/account/?LP=fiddler)
- ["Your Licenses" section](https://www.telerik.com/account/your-licenses)
- ["Licensed Users" section](https://www.telerik.com/account/manage-licensed-users/product-list)
