#### Description

In some corner cases, the Fiddler Everywhere client might not access the macOS network settings (for example, due to administrative restrictions, firewall settings, etc.). The technique demonstrated in this article will allow you to manually test the access to the active network adapter and its proxy settings on macOS.

## Accessing the Active Network Adapter Name

The Fiddler Everywhere client will use the name of the active network adapter (for example, something like **_Wi-FI_**) to set the Fiddler proxy. You can get the name manually by creating and executing a [Shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script).

1. Create a Shell file through your preferred IDE. For demonstration purposes, name ours **_test.sh_**

2. In the newly created **_test.sh_** copy and paste the following Shell script.
    ```Shell
    services=$(networksetup -listnetworkserviceorder | sed '1d;s/^([^)]*) \(.*\)$/\1FIDDLER_SEPARATOR/g;s/^.*Device: \([^)]*\))/\1/g;/^$/d' | sed 'N;s/\n//')

    while read line; do
        sname=$(echo "$line" | awk -F  "FIDDLER_SEPARATOR" '{print $1}')
        sdev=$(echo "$line" | awk -F  "FIDDLER_SEPARATOR" '{print $2}')
        if [ -n "$sdev" ]; then
            ifconfig "$sdev" 2>/dev/null | grep 'status: active' > /dev/null 2>&1
            rc="$?"
            if [ "$rc" -eq 0 ]; then
                currentservice="$sname"
                echo "\"$currentservice\""
                break
            fi
        fi
    done <<< "$(echo "$services")"

    if ! [ -n "$currentservice" ]; then
        >&2 echo "Can't find current service"
        exit 1
    fi
    ```

3. Execute the **_test.sh_** through the terminal
    ```Console
    sh <path-to-script>/test.sh
    ```

4. On success, as an output, you will see the name of the active network adapter (for demonstration purposes, let's assume the result is **_Wi-Fi_**). Not being able to get the active network adapter name successfully indicates system restrictions or wrongful network configuration.

_An example output from executing test.sh_
```
"Wi-Fi"
```

Refer to the next section on how to use this name for further troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting the Proxy Settings

Once you can successfully get the active network adapter's name, you can use it to access the OS network settings. Use the commands below to achieve the above - note that for demonstration purposes, assume that the adapter name is **_Wi-Fi_**.

```Console
networksetup -getproxyautodiscovery "Wi-Fi"
networksetup -getautoproxyurl "Wi-Fi"
networksetup -getproxybypassdomains "Wi-Fi"
networksetup -getwebproxy "Wi-Fi"
networksetup -getsecurewebproxy "Wi-Fi"
networksetup -getftpproxy "Wi-Fi"
networksetup -getsocksfirewallproxy "Wi-Fi"
```

The output from the above commands will vary depending on the OS network settings that are in place. You can use the output to troubleshoot your OS network settings with and without Fiddler Everywhere capturing mode. For example, when FIddler Everywhere is properly set to capture traffic and capturing mode is ON, the **_getsecurewebproxy_** option will return the Fiddler proxy (by default this is **127.0.0.1:8866**).

_An example output for the **networksetup -getwebproxy <adapter-name>** command when no proxy is set_
```Console
Enabled: No
Server: 
Port: 0
Authenticated Proxy Enabled: 0
```

_An example output for the **networksetup -getwebproxy <adapter-name>** command when the Fiddler Everywhere proxy is successfully set_
```Console
Enabled: Yes
Server: 127.0.0.1
Port: 8866
Authenticated Proxy Enabled: 0
```

>tip On some occasions, there might be more than one active network adapters. Use the command `networksetup -listnetworkserviceorder` to get the names of all active adapters and then use the adapter's name to troubleshoot the Fiddler Everywhere proxy settings.
