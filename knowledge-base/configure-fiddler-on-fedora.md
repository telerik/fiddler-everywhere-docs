## Description

The [instructions for installing the trusted root certificate for Fiddler Everywhere on Linux](slug://first_steps_linux#start-system-capturing) use the Debian `dpkg-reconfigure` command. However, some Linux distributions like Fedora, CentOS, and RedHat can lack the `dpkg` library or limit its usage. How can I install and trust the Fiddler root CA (certificate authority) using the `update-ca-trust` command?

## Solution

1. Install and open the Fiddler Everywhere application on a shared system certificate storage Linux distribution such as Fedora, CentOS, or RedHat.

1. Export the Fiddler Everywhere root certificate through __Settings__ > __HTTPS__ > __Advanced Settings__ > **Export root certificate(DER/Binary format)**. The CA is exported to **~/Desktop** as a file named **Fiddler_Root_Certificate_Authority.crt**.

1. Open a terminal and copy the exported CA to the shared certificate storage. The following example uses the default paths on Fedora 33.

    ```
    cp ~/Desktop/Fiddler_Root_Certificate_Authority /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
    ```

1. Trust the certificate by updating the certificate authority through the following terminal command:

    ```
    update-ca-trust
    ```

1. Return to Fiddler Everywhere and enable the HTTPS capturing by selecting the __Settings__ > __HTTPS__ > __Capture HTTPS traffic__ checkbox.
