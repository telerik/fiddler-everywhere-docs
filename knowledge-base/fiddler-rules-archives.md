The FARX abbreviation stands for Fiddler Rules Archive, the native format in which Fiddler applications (like Fiddler Everywhere and Fiddler Classic) can generate and export rules or groups of rules.

>tip The rules archives originated from Fiddler Classic, where they were used alongside the AutoResponder feature. Thus, the FARX abbreviation originally came from the Fiddler AutoResponder Archive. The Fiddler Everywhere application enhanced the AutoResponder feature through its **Rules** tab.

## Using FARX with Fiddler Everywhere

The Fiddler Everywhere application automatically recognizes the FARX extension as a native extension. Double-clicking on the FARX file immediately loads it as a new group in the Rules tab of Fiddler Everywhere.

Through the Rules toolbar, you can also manually import existing FARX files or export selected rules as FARX files.
