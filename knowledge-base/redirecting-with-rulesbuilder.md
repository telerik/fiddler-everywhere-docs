#### Description

This article demonstrates a basic example for using the [**Rules**]({%slug rules-general%}) tab for redirecting traffic from one server to another. The job can be accomplished through a rule that (optionally) utilizes regex and regex variables.


## Basic Redirect

Redirecting traffic from one server to another can be achieved through a simple WWrule.


```JS
Match: https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-everywhere/introduction
Action: http://localhost:4000/fiddler-everywhere/introduction
```

## Redirect with Regex

In some cases, you will want to create more complex redirect rules. Here Fiddler Everywhere provides regex support for creating **Match** rules and **Actions**.

```JS
Match: regex:(.*)docs.telerik.com/(.*)
Action: http://localhost:4000/$2
```

In the above case, two regex variables are automatically created. The second one will have as a value everything that comes after the last slash. 

As a result, after applying the above rule, this example endpoint
```
https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-everywhere/user-guide/live-traffic/rules-builder
```
will be redirected to
```
http://localhost:4000/fiddler-everywhere/user-guide/live-traffic/rules-builder
```
