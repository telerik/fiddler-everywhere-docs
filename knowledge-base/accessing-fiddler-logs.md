#### Environment

|---|---|
| Product  | Fiddler Everywhere  |
| Product Version | 1.0.0 and above  |

#### Description

The **Fiddler Everywhere** client is an electron application that depends on modifying the local network configuration to capture traffic. On some occasions, you might need to access the generated log files to investigate potential problems that might prevent the client from working correctly.

## Log Files

The **Fiddler Everywhere** application generates two log files as follows:
- [**electron.log**](#the-electron-log) - This is a file that logs the basic operations needed for the electron application to startup properly.
- [**netcore.log**](#the-netcore-log) file  - This is a file that logs the operations done by the Fiddler core logic (for example, applying the proxy settings, trust certificate setup, login process, etc.)

Both log files are useful to investigate cases where the client is not working properly. The location of these files varies depending on the operating system on which Fiddler Everywhere is working.

### macOS

The log files on **macOS** are available in the following folder: 
```Console
~/Library/Application Support/Fiddler Everywhere/Logs
```

### Windows

The log files on **Windows** are available in the following folder: 
```Console
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Fiddler Everywhere\Logs
```
Note that you will have to replace `<username>` with the user that is currently active on Windows.

### Linux

The log files on **Linux** are available in the following folder: 
```Console
~/.config/Fiddler Everywhere/Logs
```

## The Electron Log

The **electron.log** file will output info, warnings, and errors related to the app's startup, its connectivity, and the availability of newer versions.
