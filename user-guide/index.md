# Application Menu

The Fiddler application menu is located at the top-left corner of Fiddler Everywhere. It contains a [**View**](#view) section to customize the application and a [**Help**](#help) section with support resources. On macOS, the application also contains specific OS menus called **Fiddler Everywhere** and **Edit**

## Certificate

- **Trust Root Certificate**&mdash;Automatically installs and trusts the Fiddler certificate authority (CA) in the user certificate store of the operating system certificate manager. The option is available on [macOS](slug://first_steps_macos#start-system-capturing) and [Windows](slug://first_steps_windows#start-system-capturing). On Linux, you have to [export and trust the Fiddler CA certificate manually](slug://first_steps_linux#start-system-capturing). After you install the CA, you are ready to [enable the capturing of HTTPS traffic](#capture-https-traffic).

- **Export Root Certificate**&mdash;Automatically exports the Fiddler Everywhere CA file in a format specific to the operating system used. The certificate is exported to the `Desktop` folder. Use the **Settings > HTTPS** section to export the certificate explicitly in a specific format.

- **Reset Certificate**&mdash;Removes the currently installed CA, generates a new one, and adds it to the user certificate store. It requires elevated privileges for the Fiddler Evedrywhere application.

- **Remove Certificate**&mdash;Completely removes the currently installed FIddler CA. Requires elevated privilegies for the Fiddler Evedrywhere application.

- **Capture HTTPS Traffic**&mdash;Defines whether Fiddler Everywhere will capture HTTPS traffic or skip it. By default, this option is disabled, and Fiddler will capture only non-secure HTTP traffic. The Fiddler certificate authority must be installed and trusted to use this option.

- **Ignore Server Errors (Unsage)**&mdash;Controls whether Fiddler Everywhere warns you if an HTTPS server presents a certificate that cannot be validated.

>tip All options from the **Certificate** menu, are available through the Fiddler's **Settings** > **HTTPS** section.
