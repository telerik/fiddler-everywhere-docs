## Requests List

The **Requests** list in Fiddler Everywhere provides the option to save, modify, execute, and share previously composed requests. The [Composer](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-everywhere/user-guide/composer) tab enables you to build and send HTTP and HTTPS request manually. When you **save** a request using the Composer, the request is added to a **collection** in the **Requests** list. 

![Requests list](../images/requests/requests-list-all.png)

The Requests list contains one or more **collections** (root folders) of saved requests (or subfolders). You can also further organize your request in subfolders. To reload or start working on the saved requests, expand a collection, and double click on a selected request. 

>tip You can [**Rename**](#rename) collection, [**Delete**](#delete) collection, or make a [**New Folder**](#new-folder) using the context menu.
