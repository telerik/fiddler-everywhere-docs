## Requests

The Fiddler Everywhere client provides the opportunity to save and share the composed requests. Use the __Composer__  to save requests and add them to the collection of requests in the __Requests__ list. The __Requests__  list contains one or more collections of saved requests. Expand a collection and double-click on a selected request to reload it.

>tip Each saved request can be updated by inputting the modification (for example, in the Headers) and pressing the __Save__ button. If you want to save a new instance of already saved request use the __Save as__ drop-down option (available only for already saved requests)
