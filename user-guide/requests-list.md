# Requests Section

The **Requests** section enables you to organize and modify existing requests, which are listed in it.

For more information about building and sending HTTP and HTTPS requests, refer to the article on the [**Composer** tab]({% slug composer-tab %}).

When you save a request with the **Composer** tab, the request is added to a collection in the **Requests** list, which provides options for saving, modifying, executing, and sharing previously composed requests.

The **Requests** list is organized into collections. Each collection is a folder on the root level of the **Requests** list. A collection can contain saved requests and other subfolders. To reload or start working on the saved requests, expand a collection, and double-click a selected request. To rename or delete a collection, or make a new folder, use the [context menu options](#).
