## Sessions

The Fiddler Everywhere client provides the option to save and share the captured traffic. Use the __Live Traffic__ list's [__Save__]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#save) and [__Share__]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#share) options to save sessions to the __Sessions__ list.

## Sessions Menu

Once sessions are saved (or saved & shared), they will be appended to the __Sessions__ list. Each session comes with quick menu options.
