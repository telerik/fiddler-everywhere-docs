# Sessions Section

Fiddler Everywhere provides the option to save, modify, inspect, and share previously captured traffic.

To save sessions to the **Sessions** list, use the [**Save**]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#save) and [**Share**]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#share) options of the **Live Traffic** list.

## Working with Saved Sessions

You can select, inspect, modify, and share with collaborators previously saved sessions. The saved session entries can be saved locally or in the cloud. Sharing a session with a collaborator is done automatically when you upload the saved session entry to the cloud.

You can apply a number of actions to a saved session entry:

- To select a saved session entry from the **Sessions** list, single-click it.
- To load the [context menu](#sessions-context-menu) of a selected session entry, right-click it. The context menu provides multiple options for managing, exporting, and modifying the saved session entry.
- To open a saved session entry from the **Sessions** list in a new tab, double-click it.
- Use the UI buttons next to a saved session entry to [**Manage Users**](#manage-users) (cloud session entries only), [**Share**](#sharing-sessions), and [**Delete**](#delete) saved session entries.
- Use the UI buttons at the very top to [**Import**](#import-sessions) sessions archives or to access previously [**Shared Sessions**](#shared-sessions-list) entries.

Fiddler Everywhere provides UI solutions for sharing and collaboration.

### Sharing Loaded Saved Session
