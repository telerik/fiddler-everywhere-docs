## Gateway Menu

The __Gateway__ sub-menu provides options to easily configure how Fiddler Everywhere accesses the network. By default, Fiddler Everywhere "chains" to the system's default proxy. These settings allows you to overwrite that behavior.

## Use system proxy

__Use system proxy (recommended)__ is the default selection. Fiddler uses the OS system proxy. Some browsers and many applications use the system proxy by default and re notified when it changes. 

## Manual proxy configuration

Select __Manual proxy configuration__  to specify the upstream proxy string (first textbox) and proxy bypass list (second textbox). 

__Proxy configuration string__

The proxy configuration string could be directly set the gateway proxy:
```
proxyserver:8080
```

or the protocol-specific form
```
http=httpproxy:8080;https=httpsproxy:8080
```

__Bypass list__

The proxy bypass list supports wildcards and the special tokens `<local>` (meaning any hostname which does not contain a period) and `<-loopback>` which removes the default bypass for `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` host-names.

```
<local>;*.extranet.example.com;
```

## No proxy

Select __No proxy__ if you want to send all traffic directly to the origin server.
