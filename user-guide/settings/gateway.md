# Gateway Menu

The **Gateway** sub-menu provides options for configuring the way Fiddler Everywhere efficiently accesses the network.

By default, Fiddler Everywhere "chains" to the default proxy of the system. The **Gateway** settings allow you to override that behavior.

- (Recommended) **Use system proxy**&mdash;The default selection. Fiddler uses the OS system proxy. Some browsers and many applications use the system proxy by default and are notified when it changes.
- **Manual proxy configuration**&mdash;Specifies the upstream proxy string (first textbox) and proxy bypass list (second textbox).
    - **Proxy string**&mdash;To manually set the gateway proxy, enter the proxy string.
        - You can enter the proxy configuration string directly.
        ```curl
        proxyserver:8080
        ```
        - You can enter the proxy in the protocol-specific form.
        ```curl
        http=httpproxy:8080;https=httpsproxy:8080
        ```
    - **Bypass list**&mdash;The proxy bypass list supports the following values:
        - Wildcards. For example, `*.extranet.example.com;`.
        - The `<local>` special token, which means any host name that does not contain a period.
        - The `<-loopback>` special token, which removes the default bypass for `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` host names. The following example demonstrates how to list multiple bypass entries separated by a semicolon (`;`).
        ```curl
        *.extranet.example.com;<local>;<-loopback>;
        ```
- **No proxy**&mdash;Sends all traffic directly to the root server.

The following figure displays an example for a proxy configuration.
