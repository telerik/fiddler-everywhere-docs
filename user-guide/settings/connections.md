# Connections Menu

The **Connections** menu exposes options that allow for granular control over proxy settings and remote connection.

- **Fiddler listens on port**&mdash;Defines the port that Fiddler Everywhere uses to listen for web traffic. The default port is **8866**.
- **Act as a system proxy on startup**&mdash;Controls whether Fiddler Everywhere will be registered as the system proxy during startup. Some browsers and many applications use the system proxy by default and are notified when it changes.
- **Allow remote computers to connect**&mdash;Controls whether inbound connections to Fiddler Everywhere are allowed. Enable this option to capture traffic from remote devices.
- **Bypass Fiddler for URLs that starts with:**&mdash;Allows you to add addresses that the Fiddler Everywhere proxy will explicitly bypass.
    A common scenario for using this option is [setting up a VPN connection alongside Fiddler Everywhere]({%slug configure-vpn-fiddler%}). You can separate the individual addresses with a comma, semicolon, new line, or white space. The option will set the bypass list in the related OS settings&mdash;for example, on Windows 10, that will be **Proxy Settings** > **Proxy** > **Manual Proxy** > **Use proxy server except for addresses...**.

The following figure displays the startup settings of the **Connections** menu.
