# Welcome Page

The **Welcome Page** loads with the startup of the Fiddler Everywhere application.

The page contains information about the current release of Fiddler Everywhere, links to the official documentation, blogs, video channel, webinars, and interactive in-app tutorials.

The screen will appear on consecutive startups unless you explicitly disable it by selecting the **Don't show this window on startup** checkbox. To show the welcome page, select the **My Resources** option within the application located on the bottom-left side.
