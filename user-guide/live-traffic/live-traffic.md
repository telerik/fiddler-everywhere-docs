## Live Traffic Tab

The __Live Traffic__ tab is  is an essential feature of Fiddler Everywhere. It display a summary of each captured session (in the [**Live Traffic list**](#live-traffic-list)) and provides functionalities to work with these sessions (via the [**Live Traffic toolbar**](#live-traffic-toolbar), the [**Inspectors**]({%slug inspector-types%}) tabs, and the interconnected [**Auto Responder**]({%slug auto-responder-general%}). The section also enables sessions saving and sharing, editing issued requests, marking, commeting sessions, and applying Auto Responder rules.

>tip A **Session** (also mentioned as a **web session**) represents a single transaction between a client and a server, sometimes known as request/response pair. Each Session appears as a single entry in the Live Traffic (refer to the images below). Each Session object has a **Request** and a **Response**, representing what the client sent to the server and what the server returned to the client. The Session object also maintains a set of Flags that record metadata about the Session and a Timers object that stores timestamps logged during the Session processing.

## Live Traffic Toolbar

The Live Traffic toolbar provides various functionalities like streaming mode, decoding content, filtering by different criteria, saving, and sharing sessions.

![Live Traffic Toolbar](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-all.png)

To start capturing, you need to enable __Live Traffic__ switch to **Capturing** mode. Use the off switch state to **pause** the traffic capturing.

![Enabling Live Traffic](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-live-traffic-capturing.png)

The Live Traffic toolbar provides the following functionalities:

- [Stream](#stream)
- [Decode](#decode)
- [Advanced Filters](#advanced-filters)
- [Clear All Filters](#clear-all-filters)
- [Save](#save)
- [Share](#share)
- [Remove All](#remove-all)

### Stream

By default, Fiddler Everywhere uses __buffering mode__, which means that the responses are fully collected before any part is sent to the client. Buffering alters the responses (for example, an image won't begin to download until the containing page download is complete). With __streaming mode__, the server's responses are immediately returned to the client as it is downloaded. In streaming mode, tampering with the response body is not possible.

1. Click on the __Stream__ button to toggle between the streaming and buffering modes.

    ![Stream Toggle button](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-stream-toggle.png)

    Streaming mode is useful for low-level network timing scenarios (for example, by design, some browsers will parse partially-downloaded HTML. That would start downloading external resources in parallel before the remote server has finished delivering the content).
    
    ![Buffering mode vs Streaming Mode](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-streaming-mode.png)

    Streaming mode is also useful in cases where a site delivers audio or video streams. These kinds of never-ending streams can't be buffered by Fiddler Everywhere.

### Decode

Use the __Decode__ toggle button to remove all HTTP content and Transfer encoding from requests and responses.

1. Click on the __Toggle__ button to toggle the decoding of an encoded content.
    
    ![Decode Toggle button](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-decode-toggle.png)

_An example for HTTP response with_ *Decode* _toggled to OFF_
![Decode OFF](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-decode-off.png)

_An example for HTTP response with_ *Decode* _toggled to ON_
![Decode ON](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-decode-on.png)

### Advanced Filters

Use the __Advanced Filters__ to apply filters based on the Request and Response headers. Only sessions that are covering the filter criteria will appear in the Live Traffic list. 

1. Click on the filter button to open the advanced filters popup windows.

    ![Filter sessions button](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-filter.png)

2. The __Advanced Filters__ window allow you to set specific criteria that will filter the captured traffic. Set the filter rules and click __Apply__.

    ![Advanced filters popup](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-filter-popup.png)

Currently, the __Advanced Filters__ entries are using **AND** logical operator. Each value is complying with the **EXACT** match.

>tip Alternatively, you can apply filters through the _more_ option on each Live Traffic column (e.g., apply a filter for _Host_ column). The column filtering allows using AND and OR logical operators (for two lines) and multiple comparison rules (for example, like **Is equal to**, **contains**, **ends with**, etc.).

### Clear All Filters

Use the __Clear All Filters__ to reset all filters applied by __Advanced Filters__ and filters applied for each column (see [the columns section](#-live-traffic-columns))

![Clear All Filter  button](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-filter-clearall.png)


### Save

Use the __Save__ button to save sessions for later use or to prepare sessions for sharing.

1. Click on the __Save__ button.

    ![Save button](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-save.png)

2. A __Save Sessions__ prompt windows appears. Enter a valid name and click __Save__.

    ![Save prompt window](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-save-prompt.png)

3. The current entry (of sessions) appears in the __Sessions__ list.

>important The __Save__ button will automatically save all captured traffic. If you want to save only specific sessions, you can select the wanted sessions and use [the context menu]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#save) for advanced save options.

### Share

Sharing sessions greatly improves collaboration, and Fiddler Everywhere provides several options to export and share sessions:

- Sharing [via __Share__ button from the __Live Traffic__ list toolbar](#share-live-traffic-sessions).
- Sharing [via __Share__ button from the toolbar of the already saved session (in __Saved Sessions__)](#share-previosly-saved-sessions).
- Sharing [via __Share__ option from the __Live Traffic__ list context menu]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#share).
- Sharing by exporting saved sessions in __SAZ__ format ([via the context menu in __Saved Sessions__]({%slug saved-sessions-tab%}#export)).
- Sharing by exporting in different session formats ([via __File menu__]({%slug  file-menu%}#export-sessions))

This article section demonstrates how to share sessions using the first two options. See the linked articles for examples on how to use other sharing functionalities with Fiddler Everywhere.

The toolbar comes with a __Share__ button that will save the currently displayed sessions (captured from __Live Traffic__) in a file and then shares them through email (provided explicitly).

1. Click on the __Share__ button.

    ![Share button](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-share.png)

2. The __Save Session__ prompt window appears. You need to save the sessions before they could be shared.

    ![Saving before traffic could be shared](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-share-saveprompt.png)

3. The __Share Sessions__ prompt window appears. Enter a valid email (mandatory) and notes (optional) and click on the __Share__ button.

    ![Share prompt window](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-share-shareprompt.png)


### Remove All

The __Remove All__ button is removing __all__ currently captured traffic from the __Live Traffic__ list. To remove specific selected sessions, use the [context menu]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#remove)

![Remove All button](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-removeall.png)

## Live Traffic List

The Live Traffic list is an essential feature of Fiddler Everywhere - it displays a list of web sessions with a summary of each session that the Fiddler Everywhere client has captured.

![Live Traffic](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-list-all.png)

Many operations begin by selecting one or more entries in the Live Traffic and then activating other features.
- To select more than one Sessions, hold the __Ctrl__ (__Command__ on Mac) or __Shift__ keys while clicking on the desired rows.
- Double-click or press __Enter__ (__Return__ on Mac) to activate the default inspectors for a single selected Session.

When the Inspectors are activated, they will automatically decide which Inspector is best suited to display the selected session's request and response.
