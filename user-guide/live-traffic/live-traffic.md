## Live Traffic

The __Live Traffic__ tab is one of the most important feature of Fiddler Everywhere. It display a short summary of each captured session (in the __Live Traffic list__) and provides functionalities to work with these sessions (via the __Live Traffic toolbar__ and the Inspectors tabs). Fiddler Everywhere enables sessions saving and sharing.

>tip A **session** (also mentioned as **web session**) represents a single transaction between a client and a server, sometimes known as request/response pair. Each Session appears as a single entry in the Live Traffic (refer to the images below). Each Session object has a Request and a Response, representing what the client sent to the server and what the server returned to the client. The Session object also maintains a set of Flags that record metadata about the Session, and a Timers object that stores timestamps logged in the course of processing the Session.

## Live Traffic Toolbar

The Live Traffic toolbar provides various functionalities like streaming mode, decoding content, filtering by criteria, saving, and sharing sessions.
![Live Traffic Toolbar](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-all.png)

To start capturing, you need to enable __Live Traffic__ switch to **Capturing** mode. Use the off switch state to **pause** the traffic capturing.

### Stream

By default, Fiddler Everywhere uses __buffering mode__, which means that the responses are fully collected before any part is sent to the client. Buffering alters the responses (for example, an image won't begin to download until the containing page download is complete). With __streaming mode__, the server's responses are immediately returned to the client as it is downloaded. In streaming mode, tampering with the response body is not possible.

1. Click on the __Stream__ button to enable/disable the streaming mode.

    ![Stream Toggle button](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-stream-toggle.png)

    Streaming mode is useful for low-level network timing scenarios (for example, by design some browsers will parse partially-downloaded HTML, and that would start downloading external resources in parallel before the remote server has finished delivering the content).
    ![Buffering mode vs Streaming Mode](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-streaming-mode.png)

    Streaming mode is also useful in cases where a site delivers audo or video streams. These kind of never-ending streams can't be buffered by Fiddler Everywhere.

### Decode

Use __Decode__ toggle button to remove all HTTP content and Transfer encoding from requests and responses.

1. Click on the __Toggle__ button to enable/disable decoding the encoded content.
    ![Decode Toggle button](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-decode-toggle.png)

_Example HTTP response with_ *Decode* _toggled to OFF_

_Example HTTP response with_ *Decode* _toggled to ON_
![Decode ON](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-decode-on.png)


### Filter

Use __Filter__ to apply advanced filters based on the Request and Response headers. Only sessions that are covering the filter criteria will appear in the Live Traffic list.

1. Click on the filter button to open the advanced filters popup windows.

    ![Filter sessions button](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-filter.png)

2. The advanced filters windows allow you to set specific criteria that will filter the captured traffic. Set the filter rules and click __Apply__.

### Save

Use __Save__ buttton to save sessions for later use or to prepare sessions for sharing.

1. Click on the __Save__ button.

2. A __Save Sessions__ prompt windows appears. Enter valid name and click __Save__.

    ![Save prompt window](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-save-prompt.png)

3. The current sessions entry appears in __Sessions__ list.

>important The __Save__ button will automatically save all captured traffic. If you want to save only specific sessions, you can select the wanted sessions and use [the context menu]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#save) for advanced save options.

### Share

Sharing sessions greatly improves colaboration and Fiddler Everywhere provides several options to export and share sessions:

- Sharing [via __Share__ button from the __Live Traffic__ list toolbar](#share-live-traffic-sessions).
- Sharing [via __Share__ button from the toolbar of already saved session (in __Saved Sessions__)](#share-previosly-saved-sessions).
- Sharing [via __Share__ option from the __Live Traffic__ list context menu]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#share).
- Sharing by exporting saved sessions in __SAZ__ format ([via context menu in __Saved Sessions__]({%slug saved-sessions-tab%}#export)).
- Sharing by exporting in different session formats ([via __File menu__]({%slug  file-menu%}#export-sessions))

This article demonstrates how to share sessions using the first two options. See the linked articles for examples on how to use exporting or sharing via the context menu.

### Share Sessions

The toolbar comes with __Share__ button that will save the currently displayed sessions (captured from __Live Traffic__) in a file, and then shares them through email (provided explicitly).

1. Click on the __Share__ button.
2. The __Save Session__ prompt window appears. You need to save the sessions before they could be shared.

## Live Traffic List

The Live Traffic is an essential feature of Fiddler Everywhere - it displays a list of web sessions with summary of each session that the Fiddler Everywhere client has captured.
![Live Traffic](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-list-all.png)

Many operations begin by selecting one or more entries in the Live Traffic and then activating other features.
- To select more than one Sessions, hold the __Ctrl__ (__Command__ on Mac) or __Shift__ keys while clicking on the desired rows.
- Double-click or press __Enter__ (__Return__ on Mac) to activate the default inspectors for a single selected Session.

When the Inspectors are activated, they will automatically decide which Inspector is best suited to display the selected session's request and response.

### Live Traffic Columns

Certain key information is displayed in the columns of the Live Traffic, including:

- __\#__ - An identification number generated by Fiddler Everywhere
- __Result__ - The status code from the response
- __Protocol__ - The protocol (HTTP/HTTPS/FTP) used by the Session
- __Host__ - The hostname and the port of the server to which the request was sent
- __URL__ - The URL path, file, and query string from the request
- __Method__ - The HTTP Method used by the request (GET, POST, etc.)
- __Body__ - The number of bytes in the response body
- __Caching__ - Values from the Response's Expires and Cache-Control headers
- __Content-Type__ The Content-Type header from the response
- __Process__ The local OS process from which the traffic originated
- __Comments__ Field for showing the custom comments added by you (or the author of a shared session).

See a detailed explanation for the values in each column in the [View Live Traffic Summary]({%slug web-session-summary%}) article.

### Live Traffic Context Menu

The context menu for the Live Traffic exposes several actions that can be applied for a Session or multiple Sessions.To show the context menu, press right-click on Windows (__Control__ + mouse click on Mac).
