# Live Traffic Tab

The __Live Traffic__ tab is an essential feature of Fiddler Everywhere. It display a summary of each captured session (in the [**Live Traffic list**](#live-traffic-list)) and provides functionalities to work with these sessions (via the [**Live Traffic toolbar**](#live-traffic-toolbar), the [**Inspectors**]({%slug inspector-types%}) tabs, and the interconnected [**Auto Responder**]({%slug auto-responder-general%}). The section also enables sessions saving and sharing, editing issued requests, marking, commenting sessions, and applying Auto Responder rules.

>tip A **Session** (also mentioned as a **web session**) represents a single transaction between a client and a server, sometimes known as for request/response pair. Each session appears as a single entry in the Live Traffic (refer to the images below). Each Session object has a **Request** and a **Response**, representing what the client sent to the server and what the server returned to the client. The Session object also maintains a set of Flags that record metadata about the session and a Timers object that stores timestamps logged during the Session processing.

## Live Traffic Toolbar

The Live Traffic toolbar provides various functionalities like streaming mode, decoding content, filtering by different criteria, saving, and sharing sessions.


To start capturing traffic, you need to enable __Live Traffic__ switch to **Capturing** mode. Use the off switch state to **pause** the traffic capturing (**Paused** mode).

The Live Traffic toolbar provides the following functionalities:

- [Stream](#stream)
- [Advanced Filters](#advanced-filters)
- [Clear All Filters](#clear-all-filters)
- [Save](#save)
- [Share](#share)
- [Remove All](#remove-all)
- [Search](#search)


![Live Traffic Toolbar](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-all.png)

### Stream

By default, Fiddler Everywhere uses __buffering mode__, which means that the responses are fully collected before any part is sent to the client. Buffering alters the responses (for example, an image won't begin to download until the containing page download is complete). With __streaming mode__, the server's responses are immediately returned to the client as it is downloaded. In streaming mode, tampering with the response body is not possible.

1. Click on the __Stream__ button to toggle between the streaming and buffering modes.

    Streaming mode is useful for low-level network timing scenarios (for example, by design, some browsers will parse partially-downloaded HTML. That would start downloading external resources in parallel before the remote server has finished delivering the content).
    
    ![Buffering mode vs Streaming Mode](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-streaming-mode.png)

    Streaming mode is also useful in cases where a site delivers audio or video streams. These kinds of never-ending streams can't be buffered by Fiddler Everywhere.

### Advanced Filters

Use the __Advanced Filters__ to apply filters based on the Request and Response headers. Only sessions that are covering the filter criteria will appear in the Live Traffic list. 

1. Click on the filter button to open the advanced filters popup windows.

2. The __Advanced Filters__ window allows you to set specific criteria that will filter the captured traffic. Set the filter rules and click __Apply__.

    ![Advanced filters popup](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-filter-popup.png)

Currently, the __Advanced Filters__ entries are using **AND** logical operator. Each value is complying with the **EXACT** match.

>tip Alternatively, you can apply filters through the _more_ option on each Live Traffic column (e.g., apply a filter for _Host_ column). The column filtering allows using AND and OR logical operators (for two lines), and multiple comparison rules (for example, like **Is equal to**, **contains**, **ends with**, etc.).

### Clear All Filters

Use the __Clear All Filters__ to reset all filters applied by __Advanced Filters__ and filters applied for each column (see [the columns section](#-live-traffic-columns))


### Save

Use the __Save__ button to save sessions for later use or prepare sessions for sharing.

1. Click on the __Save__ button.

2. A __Save Sessions__ prompt windows appear. Enter a valid name and click __Save__.

    ![Save prompt window](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-save-prompt.png)

3. The current entry (of sessions) appears in the __Sessions__ list.

>important The __Save__ button will automatically save all captured traffic. If you want to keep only specific sessions, you can select the wanted sessions and use [the context menu]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#save) for advanced save options.

### Share

Sharing sessions greatly improves collaboration, and Fiddler Everywhere provides several options to export and share sessions:

- Sharing via the __Share__ button from a saved session entry in [the __Sessions__ list]({%slug saved-sessions-tab%}#sharing-sessions)).
- Sharing via the __Share__ option from [the __Live Traffic__ list context menu]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#share).
- Sharing via the __Share__ button from the __Live Traffic__ list toolbar (see details below).

The toolbar comes with a __Share__ button that will save the currently displayed sessions (captured from __Live Traffic__) in a file and then shares them through email (provided explicitly).

1. Click on the __Share__ button.

2. The __Save Session__ prompt window appears. You need to save the sessions before they could be shared.

    ![Saving before traffic could be shared](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-share-saveprompt.png)

3. The __Share Sessions__ prompt window appears. Enter a valid email (mandatory) and notes (optional) and click on the __Share__ button.

    ![Share prompt window](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-toolbar-share-shareprompt.png)


### Remove All

Use the __Remove All__ button to remove __all__ captured traffic from the __Live Traffic__ list. To remove specific selected sessions, use the [context menu]({%slug web-sessions-list%}#remove)


### Search

Use the __Search__ text input to search for specific values in the URL and the Headers of all sessions. The search action will immediately filter and show all sessions that are containing the search term.


## Live Traffic List

The Live Traffic list is an essential feature of Fiddler Everywhere - it displays a list of web sessions with a summary of each session that the Fiddler Everywhere client has captured.

![Live Traffic](../../images/livetraffic/websessions/websessions-list-columns.png)

Many operations begin by selecting one or more entries in the Live Traffic and then activating other features.
- To select more than one Session, hold the __Ctrl__ (__Command__ on Mac) or __Shift__ keys while clicking on the desired rows.
- Double-click or press __Enter__ (__Return__ on Mac) to activate the default inspectors for a single selected Session.

When the Inspectors are activated, they will automatically decide which Inspector is best suited to display the selected session's request and response.

- __Process__ - The local OS process from which the traffic originated (for example _chrome:8212_ indicates a Google Chrome browser instance).
- __Client IP__ - Indicates the client IP that sent this request. Mostly useful when multiple computers on a network are pointed to a single Fiddler instance.
- __Remote IP__ - Indicates the IP address of the server used for this request.
- __Body Size__ - The number of bytes in the response body.
- __Caching__ - Values from the Response's **Expires** and **Cache-Control** headers.

- __Comments__ A field for showing the custom comments added by you (or the author of a shared session).


### Live Traffic Sorting

By default, the captured traffic is sorted in the order they appear during the traffic capturing (sort by the unique identification number column). Create a custom sorting order by clicking on the desired column. For example, click on the **URL** column to sort alphabetically based on the URL, or click on the **Body Size** column to sort based on the bytes' session size.

### Filter and Columns Options

Each column comes with a **more** button (three vertical dots), which opens a popup with additional **Filter**  and **Columns** submenus. 

Use the **Filter** submenu to apply filters for the currently selected column only (e.g., filter all the traffic by _host_ name or by a specific _status code_). Columns with active filters will have a blue filter indicator. You can clear active filters via the **Filter** popup (for the filtered column) or use the global [__Clear All Filters__ button](#clear-all-filters).

![Filter context submenu](../../images/livetraffic/columns/dots-filter.png)

Use the **Columns** submenu to select which column should be visible in the **Live Traffic** list. By default, all columns are visible. Refer to the [KB article "How to View Web Session Summary"]({%slug how-to-view-web-session-summary%}) for detailed information about each column type.

![Columns context submenu](../../images/livetraffic/columns/dots-columns.png)
