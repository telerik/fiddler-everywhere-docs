# Connections Section

The **Connections** section is located at the bottom-right corner of the Fiddler Everywhere and contains valuable information about the state of the connection and the network configuration.


The section will popup on mouse interaction and will list the following information:

- **Network Connection***&mdash;Shows the state of the network that provides the internet connectivity.

- A list of the active network adapters on the machine that hosts Fiddler Everywhere. Each entry is listed by its IPv6 address and by its IPv4 address.

The following figure demonstrates the **Connections** section.
