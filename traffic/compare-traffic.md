# Comparing Traffic

>tip The **Compare Sessions (BETA)** feature is under active development and subject to additional changes and improvements in future releases.


## Comparing Live Traffic Sessions

Fiddler Everywhere provides a comparing option for detailed differentiation of two or more captured sessions from the [**Live Traffic**]({%slug web-sessions-list%}) list.

1. Set **Live Traffic** to **Capturing** and make the requests. As a result, the sessions are captured and displayed in the **Live Traffic** list.

1. Select two sessions that you want to compare.

1. Select the **Compare** option from the context menu and choose the **Compare in Fiddler Everywhere** nested option. Note that the **Compare** option is active only when **two** sessions are selected.

1. Inspect both sessions in a new [**Compare Sessions (BETA**) tab](#compare-sessions-beta-section).

    ![Compare Sessions tab](../images/livetraffic/compare/compare-tab-001.png)


Fiddler Everywhere loads both sessions side-by-side with the session with a lower ID to the left (named **Group 1**) and the session with the higher ID to the right (named **Group 2**). The differences are highlighted in the session inspectors by a red background highlight for the removed content from the primary session and a green background highlight for newly added content in the secondary session. Additional sessions can be added to both groups, simultaneously comparing multiple sessions.


### Adding Sessions to the Compare Groups

You can add and compare more sessions by adding them to the comparison groups.

1. Set **Live Traffic** to **Capturing** and make the requests. As a result, the sessions are captured and displayed in the **Live Traffic** list.

1. Select one or more sessions that you want to compare.

1. Select the **Add to compare group** option from the context menu and select the compare group where the session should be added.

## Comparing Saved Sessions

With Fiddler Everywhere, you can compare previously saved sessions from the [**Sessions**]({%slug saved-sessions-tab%}) section.

1. Select a saved entry from the [**Sessions**]({%slug saved-sessions-tab%}) section that you would like to compare.

1. Select the **Compare** option from the context menu.

1. Inspect both sessions in a new [**Compare Sessions (BETA**) tab](#compare-sessions-beta-section).


## Compare Sessions (BETA) Section

The **Compare Sessions (BETA)** section consists of a tab that loads a grid containing the sessions (or groups of sessions) and inspectors comparing the selected sessions' HTTP requests and responses. The section also has a toolbar that provides the [comparing options](#comparing-options) and the ability to rearrange the tab user interface.

### Comparing Options

The **Compare Sessions (BETA)** tab provides the following options to customize your comparing criteria.

- **Match sessions by**&mdash;Highlights unmatched sessions with default criteria set to match by **URL**. The possible match options are as follows:
    - **URL** match to highlight sessions with different URLs.
    - **Order** match session by their order in their ID column. The ID is the Fiddler Everywhere unique identification for each captured session.

- **Ignore Headers**&mdash;You can use the popup to create an ignore list of specific requests and response headers from the matching.
