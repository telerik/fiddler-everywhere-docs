# Fiddler Everywhere Prompt Library

Welcome to the Fiddler Everywhere Prompt Libraryâ€”your comprehensive resource for AI-powered HTTP traffic analysis and debugging.

This library provides ready-to-use prompts optimized for the Fiddler Everywhere [MCP Server]({%slug fiddler-mcp-server%}). Whether you're performing web debugging, security analysis, performance optimization, or data extraction, these prompts will help you maximize productivity by leveraging AI assistance with your captured HTTPS traffic.

>tip Start with the [built-in prompts](#built-in-mcp-prompts) for quick actions, or explore [custom prompts](#custom-prompts) for advanced scenarios.

## Built-in MCP Prompts

The Fiddler Everywhere MCP server includes predefined system prompts for common operations. These built-in prompts provide quick access to Fiddler's core functionality directly from your AI-powered IDE.

### How to Use Built-in Prompts

1. Start your AI-powered IDE in **agent mode**.
2. Type `/mcp.fiddler.` to display all available built-in prompts.
3. Select the desired prompt or continue typing to autocomplete.

### Available Built-in Prompts

#### Reverse Proxy Operations

```sh
/mcp.fiddler.add-reverse-proxy-port
```
Configures a reverse proxy in Fiddler. You will be prompted for:
- Client port to listen on (1025-65535)
- Remote host to forward traffic to

```sh
/mcp.fiddler.remove-reverse-proxy-port
```
Removes a previously configured reverse proxy port. You will be prompted for the client port number.

```sh
/mcp.fiddler.enable-reverse-proxy
```
Activates the reverse proxy functionality in Fiddler Everywhere.

```sh
/mcp.fiddler.disable-reverse-proxy
```
Deactivates the reverse proxy functionality in Fiddler Everywhere.

## Custom Prompts

Beyond the built-in prompts, you can use natural language to create custom prompts tailored to your specific debugging and analysis needs. The Fiddler Everywhere MCP server understands conversational queries and can perform complex operations based on your instructions.

All custom prompts in this library use the `#fiddler` handle to target the [MCP Server]({%slug fiddler-mcp-server%}). Ensure you have [installed and enabled the MCP Server]({%slug fiddler-mcp-server%}#installation) before using these prompts.

### How to Use Custom Prompts

1. **Browse** the prompt library to find a prompt that matches your use case.
2. **Copy** the prompt text, including the `#fiddler` handle.
3. **Customize** (optional) the prompt for your specific scenario, replacing placeholders like `{keyword}`, `{clientPort}`, or `{remoteHost}` with actual values.
4. **Run** the prompt in your AI-powered IDE's agent mode.

>warning Always review and validate the code, configurations, and solutions proposed by AI-powered tools before applying them to your production environment.

### Capture and Session Management

Start capturing traffic and manage your sessions with these essential prompts:

```
#fiddler Start capturing HTTP traffic in Fiddler using Chrome
```

```
#fiddler Start capturing HTTP traffic in Fiddler using a Terminal
```

```
#fiddler Add a reverse proxy, listening on {clientPort} and forwarding traffic to {remoteHost}
```

```
#fiddler Disable the reverse proxy
```

```
#fiddler Apply a filter to capture traffic that contains localhost
```

```
#fiddler Apply a filter to capture traffic that contains {keyword}
```

```
#fiddler Show filtered sessions
```

```
#fiddler Clear all filters
```

```
#fiddler Clear all captured sessions
```

### Traffic Analysis

Analyze captured HTTP traffic to understand application behavior and identify issues:

```
#fiddler Analyze the captured HTTP traffic
```

```
#fiddler Analyze session with ID {sessionId}
```

```
#fiddler Summarize all API calls made to {domain}
```

```
#fiddler Show me all failed requests (status codes 4xx and 5xx)
```

```
#fiddler List all sessions with response times greater than 2 seconds
```

```
#fiddler Extract all unique domains from the captured traffic
```

### Security Analysis

```
#fiddler Does the filtered sessions contain sanitized data
```

```
#fiddler Analyze the captured sessions for leaked sensitive data
```

```
#fiddler Analyze the captured sessions and suggest security optimizations
```

## Tips for Creating Effective Custom Prompts

When crafting your own custom prompts, consider these best practices:

- **Be specific**: Include domain names, session IDs, or specific criteria to narrow down the analysis.
- **Use filters**: Apply filters before complex analysis to reduce processing time and improve accuracy.
- **Combine operations**: Ask for multiple related tasks in a single prompt (e.g., "analyze and create a report").
- **Leverage context**: Reference previous prompts or analyses to build on earlier work.
- **Iterate**: Start with broad questions and refine based on the results.
